<p><a href="https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-mm1-apples-first-large-multimodal-model/" target="_blank">Apple's AI emergence</a> continues apace ahead of WWDC. We've covered <a href="https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-ai2-releases-olmo-the-4th-open-everything/" target="_blank">OLMo</a> before, and it looks like OpenELM is Apple's first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14619?utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">actually open LLM</a> (<a href="https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM?utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">weights</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/corenet?utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">code</a>) release sharing some novel research in the efficient architecture direction.</p>

<p>It's not <em>totally</em> open, but it's pretty open. As <a href="https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1783480053847736713/photo/1?utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">Sebastian Raschka put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's start with the most interesting tidbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenELM comes in 4 relatively small and convenient sizes: 270M, 450M, 1.1B, and 3B</li>
<li>OpenELM performs slightly better than OLMo even though it's trained on 2x fewer tokens</li>
<li>The main architecture tweak is a layer-wise scaling strategy</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sharing details is not the same as explaining them, which is what research papers were aimed to do when I was a graduate student. For instance, they sampled a relatively small subset of 1.8T tokens from various publicly available datasets (RefinedWeb, RedPajama, The PILE, and Dolma). This subset was 2x smaller than Dolma, which was used for training OLMo. What was the rationale for this subsampling, and what were the criteria?"</p>

<p>The layer-wise scaling comes from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00623?utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">DeLight</a>, a 2021 paper deepening the standard attention mechanism 2.5-5x in number of layers but matching 2-3x larger models by parameter count. These seem paradoxical but the authors described the main trick of varying the depth between the input and the output, rather than uniform:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding RoPE and Extrapolation</strong>: RoPE scaling's effectiveness was debated, with one member sharing that changing the RoPE base during fine-tuning, not pretraining, enhances a model's ability to handle longer contexts as per a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05209?utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">research paper</a>. However, it was clarified that <strong>Llama 3</strong> was pretrained with a 500k RoPE base, without changing the base, in an attempt to decrease RoPE decay factor for longer contexts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extrapolation Tokens Outweigh Pretraining</strong>: The community discussed the relationship between the number of pretraining tokens and the model's ability to extrapolate, concluding that extensive pretraining is necessary before any further pretraining with higher RoPE bases to prevent loss of extrapolation capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>PoSE as an Alternative</strong>: A member referenced Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) as a novel training method that simulates long inputs using a fixed context window, which could potentially address limitations of relative positional encodings. The method smartly chunks the original context window for efficient extension, as described in the <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=3Z1gxuAQrA&amp;utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">associated paper</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Scaling of RoPE Base Debated</strong>: One member solicited insights on how to scale RoPE base with context length, with a community expert noting that setting the base to an arbitrarily high number and then doing empirical testing is common, rather than any systematic linear scaling.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endorsement for Better Positional Encodings</strong>: The conversation highlighted RoPE as potentially inadequate for long context generalization and proposed alternatives like YaRN or LongRoPE, specifically mentioning that LongRoPE is utilized in the <strong>phi-3-128k</strong> model.</li>

<li><strong>Linear Attention Breakdown Explained</strong>: A member provided a thorough explanation of how linear attention works by separating ( QK^T V ) into ( Q(K^T V) ) for inference. It was clarified that this approach is linear with respect to sequence length and maintains constant memory usage, unlike softmax attention which grows over time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benchmarking Beyond Hypothesized Formats</strong>: A member reported "benchmarking" phi-3-mini-128k against other models, suggesting its performance might be on par with Llama-3-8B. The discussion evolved around whether the pre-training data significantly influences post-training performance and what constitutes a "base" in the context of AI models like phi.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Needle in the Haystack Tests Scrutinized</strong>: Users questioned the efficacy of "needle in the haystack" tests for long-context language models, suggesting real-world application and personal testing are more indicative performance benchmarks. There is skepticism about how such a test accounts for the semantic similarity between the "needle" and its surrounding context.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Masking User Prompt Loss During SFT</strong>: There was curiosity whether masking the user prompt loss during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on language models had been systematically studied.

<ul>
<li><strong>Revolutionizing Visual Representation Learning</strong>: A novel weakly supervised pre-training method for vision models was highlighted, which categorizes pre-training on image-text data as a classification task. This approach has achieved a training speed that is <strong>2.7 times faster</strong> than traditional contrastive learning, without compromising the quality of representations, as detailed in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15653?utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">arXiv paper</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple Yet Effective</strong>: Building on the previous point, the method's success was attributed to detecting concepts from alt-text and training a multilabel classifier. It was noted that this led to the model performing comparably to <strong>CLIP</strong> in zero-shot scenarios and with greatly improved training efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Cost of Contrast</strong>: In a conversation about the efficacy of text encoders and contrastive learning, it was pointed out that contrastive learning, especially while aligning text encoders, is costly. The approach can incur extra computational expenses when dealing with noisy alt text.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast Yet Still Lengthy</strong>: A humorous comment was shared acknowledging that while a 2.7x speed increase in training was significant, the overall process remains time-intensive. This reflects a realistic perspective on the improvements in speed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exploring VAST Possibilities</strong>: Interest was expressed in finetuning <strong>VAST</strong>, a Vision-Audio-Subtitle-Text Omni-Modality Foundation Model and Dataset, with a link provided to the project's <a href="https://github.com/txh-mercury/vast?utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</li>

The conversation shifted towards the use of multimodal models like <strong>LLaVA</strong> available on <a href="https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-v1.6-34b?utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">Hugging Face</a>, highlighting its foundation on <strong>NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolving Loops and Model Performance</strong>: Participants exchanged tips on optimizing local models to prevent looping behavior, suggesting adjustments such as modifying <em>temperature settings</em>, <em>prompt editing</em>, or <em>architectural changes</em>. The concept of a <em>frustration metric</em> was also introduced to adapt a model's behavior after encountering successive loops.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration Exploration and Error Troubleshooting</strong>: A user pondered the integration of <strong>Open Interpreter</strong> for robot control, specifically with the <strong>Unitree GO2 robodog</strong>, asking for community experience. Others discussed technical issues and solutions for running local servers, such as setting dummy API keys and resolving namespace conflicts in Pydantic model configurations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Interpreter 'New Computer Update' Non-Beta Release</strong>: A user confirmed running <strong>Open Interpreter 0.2.5 New Computer Update</strong>, indicating the version that includes the recent enhancements is out of beta. However, there was a question about the update's status change from beta, leading to a clarification through a version check.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Debating Claude’s Capabilities</strong>: An online discussion explored <strong>Claude’s RLAIF training</strong> as light-handed and well-executed. It is reported that Claude’s behavior shows unexpected structure and a deep understanding, ‘mostly orthogonal’ to Anthropic’s vision, giving off "Jungian individuation" and "Bodhisattva vibes." The thread also speculates on the effects of RLAIF versus the base model’s latent dynamics and discusses the potential for Claude's mode collapse to be rectified (<a href="https://x.com/repligate/status/1783426037210026372?s=46&amp;t=xxWoJxAS_7-BBFC2ro84Zw&amp;utm_source=ainews&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its" target="_blank">Claude’s conversation thread</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>RLHF vs. KTO in Commercial Deployments</strong>: In response to a query about the stability of <strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</strong>, it’s suggested that its application depends on the context, and that <strong>Knowledge-Targeted Optimization (KTO)</strong> might be better suited for certain applied tasks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transitioning Training Methods for Improved Results</strong>: A mention of an interview shares an experience where moving from <strong>Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT)</strong> to <strong>Data Programming by Demonstration (DPO)</strong> provided better outcomes, and subsequently moving to <strong>KTO</strong> further improved performance based on user feedback.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complications and Nuance in RLHF</strong>: There’s an assertion that <strong>RLHF</strong> is more nuanced than commonly thought, particularly when considering the variety of data and how it interacts with downstream evaluation metrics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding Grad Norm Spikes</strong>: The channel requested clarity on why spikes in gradient norms during pretraining might be undesirable, but no detailed explanation was provided in the response.</li>

<li><strong>The "Pick Your Brain" Conundrum</strong>: <em>Nathan Lambert</em> mentioned his discomfort with the term <strong>"pick your brain"</strong> especially now that he tends to decline such requests due to being busy.</li>
<li><strong>Humorous Take on Brain Picking</strong>: <em>Vsreekanti</em> responded humorously to the discomfort toward <strong>brain-picking</strong>, suggesting that one should inquire about the type of pick, jokingly preferring a lobotomy.</li>
<li><strong>Brain Picking as Vague Request</strong>: <em>Drj.bet</em> added that the phrase <strong>"pick your brain"</strong> often implies a desire for conversation without a specific question in mind.</li>
