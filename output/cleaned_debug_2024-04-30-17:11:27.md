 :
 [@bindureddy](https://twitter.com/bindureddy/status/1784698453802545318?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-a-quiet-weekend) 
 argues that
 **language models may soon hit a wall due to the limits of human language, reasoning, and the inability to surpass a certain level on benchmarks** 
 like MMLU despite increased compute or data.



**Advancements in Vision-Language Models and Video Understanding** 



* **PLLaVA: Parameter-free LLaVA Extension to Videos** 
 :
 [@\_akhaliq](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1784752877493203416?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-a-quiet-weekend) 
 introduces PLLaVA, which extends the LLaVA framework to

 shares a paper on using
 **six-bit quantization (FP6) to reduce the size of LLMs while preserving model quality** 
 across various applications and model sizes. The paper introduces TC-FPx, a GPU kernel design scheme supporting float-point weights for various quantization bit-widths, enabling practical performance improvements during LLM inference.
* **Proxy-Tuning: Efficient Customization of Large LMs** 
 :
 [@rohanpaul\_ai](https://twitter.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1784559710978404861?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-a-quiet-weekend) 
 explains Proxy-Tuning, a
 **lightweight decoding-time algorithm that achieves the result of directly tuning a large LM by using smaller tuned LMs to shift the original predictions** 
 . This approach allows for efficient customization of large, potentially proprietary LMs through decoding-time guidance.
* **Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Crafting for Instruction Tuning** 
 :
 [@rohanpaul\_ai](https://twitter.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1784999595413504342?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-a-quiet-weekend) 
 discusses a paper proposing Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Crafting (PESC), which
 **converts dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models for efficient instruction tuning** 
 . PESC inserts adapters into each expert, updating only the adapter parameters, significantly reducing computational costs and memory requirements while achieving state-of-the-art performance.



**Regulations and Policy**

 :
 [@nearcyan](https://twitter.com/nearcyan/status/1784864119491100784?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-a-quiet-weekend) 
 shared details on California Bill 1047 which has been fast-tracked. The bill
 **covers all models made with 10^26 flops or similar performance** 
 , requires developers to assert models are safe under penalty of perjury, and creates a Frontier Model Division to report to.
* **Concerns with California SB-1047** 
 :
 [@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1784717268368367665?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-a-quiet-weekend) 
 expressed concerns that California SB-1047 "Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act" could
 **do great harm to startups, American innovation, open source, and safety** 
 . The bill imposes overly broad definitions, misunderstands dual use, has restrictive requirements, and disincentivizes openness.
