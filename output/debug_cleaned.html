   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Let's start with the most interesting tidbits:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      OpenELM comes in 4 relatively small and convenient sizes: 270M, 450M, 1.1B, and 3B
     </li>
     <li>
      OpenELM performs slightly better than OLMo even though it's trained on 2x fewer tokens
     </li>
     <li>
      The main architecture tweak is a layer-wise scaling strategy
     </li>
    </ul>

   <p>
    But:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     "Sharing details is not the same as explaining them, which is what research papers were aimed to do when I was a graduate student. For instance, they sampled a relatively small subset of 1.8T tokens from various publicly available datasets (RefinedWeb, RedPajama, The PILE, and Dolma). This subset was 2x smaller than Dolma, which was used for training OLMo. What was the rationale for this subsampling, and what were the criteria?"

    The layer-wise scaling comes from
