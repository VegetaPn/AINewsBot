 In the agent literature it is common to find that multiple agents outperform single agents (if you conveniently ignore inference cost).
 [Cohere has now found the same for LLMs-as-Judges](https://twitter.com/cohere/status/1785284142789242932?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-to-be-named-4408)
